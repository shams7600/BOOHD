Lists categories, author pages and archives with thumbnails.

== Description ==

These two rows must be in function.php in the theme for the plugin to work:

add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );

set_post_thumbnail_size( form_option('thumbnail_size_w&&echo=false'), form_option('thumbnail_size_h&&echo=false'), true );

You'll also need to add thumbnails to the posts you want visible in the list.

After that, all you need to do is to add the hook [categorythumbnaillist 3] (where 3 is a categoy id) to your post.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload "categoy-thumbnail-list" to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory
2. Add the following rows to your themes functions.php
add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );
set_post_thumbnail_size( form_option('thumbnail_size_w&&echo=false'), form_option('thumbnail_size_h&&echo=false'), true );
3. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
4. Add the hook in a post. Example: [categorythumbnaillist 3]
